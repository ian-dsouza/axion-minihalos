# axion-minihalos
A code for computing the survival mass fraction of axion minihalos due to stellar interactions.

The _Data_ folder contains data files associated with previous journal articles. The _Figure_ folders contain Python files to generate output quantities. These folders also contain a Python file to generate the corresponding figures. The figure numbers are the same as in the journal article: [Disruption of dark matter minihalos by successive stellar encounters](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.123035)
