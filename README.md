# axion-minihalos
A code for computing the survival mass fraction of axion minihalos due to stellar interactions.

### Using the code

The _Data_ folder contains data files associated with previous journal articles. The _Figure_ folders contain Python files to generate output quantities. These folders also contain a Python file to generate the corresponding figures. The figure numbers are the same as in the journal article: [Disruption of dark matter minihalos by successive stellar encounters](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.109.123035).

Each Python or Jupyter Notebook contains a _#PARAMETERS_ section in the code immediately after importing the libraries. You can adjust the parameters of the file by modifying the values of each parameter. The plotting code files have a parameter _save_to_disk_. Set this parameter to _True_ if you want to save the generated figure.
